###### Quote: Johan Wolfgang von Goethe, 1749-1842 (translated from German)

The moment you commit yourself, then providence moves too. All manner of things happen to help you that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events are started by the decision, creating all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance in your favour, which no-one could have dreamed would have come your way. Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. Begin it now.
