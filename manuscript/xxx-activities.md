###### Activity: Practising gratefulness

Close your eyes and begin to think of all the things you should be grateful for: your health, your family, your friends, your happiness. Thank each person you see in your mind's eye with a loving 'Thank you'. Continue for 3-5 minutes.

###### Activity: 4 questions to find your work calling:

1. Does it energise you? E.g. Can you do it everyday without getting tired? Are you mentally/emotionally healthier as a result?
2. Does it impact people? E.g. Do other people transform as a result of your work?
3. Does it reward you? E.g. Financially and/or emotionally? Is that reward enough for you?
4. Does it transform you? E.g. Can you see yourself growing year-by-year by doing this work?
