# The Beginning

## Childhood
Let's start at the beginning &mdash; childhood.

When we are growing up we are influenced by a number of things:
* Parents - The parents we were born to, including their culture and religion, if they have one
* Media - news, websites, social media etc.
* Friends - The friends we make in or outside of school
* Teachers - The teachers at school
* Neighbourhood - The community we grew up in
* Country - The country we live in

But the biggest influence out of all of these by far is **parents**, so let's take a closer look at our parents and how they have shaped us.

## Parents

Let's admit it, there's always something about our own parents we dislike. Something we find hard to accept about them.

Another thing is for certain too: we never got to choose our parents!

But despite that what studies in Psychology, specifically a field called Transactional Analysis, show is that the better relationship we have with our parents, the better our own lives turn out.

If you are an orphan or adopted child, then you may have to also forgive your birth parents *and* create a good relationship with your foster parents, guardians or carers. Just a little more homework for you!

###### Fact: In Indian culture, parents are considered equal to God and for that reason a lot of children are taught to touch their parent's feet to humble themselves before them, or in some cases, children will even bow down to their parents to worship them like a God!
